@section Overview {
    <h1 class="tabMobile">Healthcare</h1>
    <br />
    Healthcare is a multi-billion dollar business, whereas spending within the industry is in the focus of all stakeholders – patients, regulators, payers, employers and providers. Challenged with finding ways to better deliver cost-effective and quality care experiences to patients, healthcare organizations are pushing innovations into the core of their business and service models. This is fueled by the exponential growth of digital medical data that needs to be properly stored and managed.   
    <br />
    <br />
    Moreover, empowered with new technologies, consumers are nowadays more engaged and selective with their choices in healthcare plans, providers and treatments. Ensuring improved access to relevant information about doctors, hospitals, diseases and financial aspects can significantly help patients identify the optimal care pathway.<br />
    <br />
    All these factors put a great emphasis on the role of information technology in providing high standards of patient care. Therefore, reliable and flexible software solutions and IT systems play the pivotal role in creating safer, smarter and more patient-centric healthcare systems.<br />
